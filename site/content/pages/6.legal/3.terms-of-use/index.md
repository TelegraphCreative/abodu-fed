  Abodu may offer a registered user account to its users. You are responsible for any use of the Site or Services or other activity that occurs through the use of your account, including without limitation any use of your account by any other third party.
  
  As part of the registration process, each user will select, at a minimum, a password and login name. You shall provide Abodu with accurate, complete, and updated account information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your account. You may not: (i) select or use a login name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use a name subject to the rights of any other person without authorization; or (iii) use a login name that Abodu, in its sole discretion, deems inappropriate or offensive. You shall immediately notify Abodu of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password. You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your account, at Abodu’s sole discretion, and you may be reported to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.
  
  ##14. Digital Millennium Copyright Act
  
  Abodu respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects our users to do the same. Abodu investigates notices of copyright infringement and takes appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c), as follows:
  
  For purposes of providing written notice under the DMCA, Abodu has designated an agent with the United States Copyright Office (“Copyright Agent”). All written notification, pursuant to the DMCA, must be submitted to the designated Copyright Agent at the following address:
  DMCA Complaints
  Tel: 650.279.0168
  Abodu, Inc.
  4057 Jefferson Ave.
  Redwood City, CA 94062.
  Email: hello@Abodu.com
  
  If you are a copyright owner or agent thereof and believe that third-party submitted content or materials, including photographs and digital images (each a “Third-Party Submission”), available through this Site infringes upon your copyrights, you may submit written notification, pursuant to the DMCA, to Abodu’s Copyright Agent, identified above. To be effective, the written notification must include:
  a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
  identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
  identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Abodu to locate the material;
  information reasonably sufficient to permit Abodu to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
  a statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
  a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
  If you believe that your Third-Party Submission, which was removed (or to which access was disabled), is not infringing, or that you have authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent or authority under the law, to publish or use the Third-Party Submission, you may submit a written counter-notice, pursuant to the DMCA, to Abodu’s Copyright Agent, identified above. To be effective, the written counter-notice must include:
  your physical or electronic signature;
  identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
  a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material; and
  your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which your address is located (or San Mateo County, State of California, if your address is outside of the United States), and that you will accept service of process from the person, or the person’s agent, who provided notification of the alleged copyright infringement.
  If a counter-notice is received by Abodu’s Copyright Agent, Abodu may send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party (or agent thereof) informing that person that Abodu may replace the removed Third-Party Submission or cease disabling it in ten business days. Unless the copyright owner (or agent thereof) files an action seeking a court order against the provider of the Third-Party Submission, the removed Third-Party Submission may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at Abodu’s sole discretion.
  Please note that under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing, or that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or identification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider (such as or including Abodu), who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of the service provider relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it. Accordingly, if you are uncertain whether Third-Party Submission infringes your or others’ copyrights, please consult with a copyright attorney prior to making a notice under the DMCA.
  
  ##15. Miscellaneous Terms.
  
  (a) Complete Agreement.
  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and Abodu relating to your use of, and access to, the Site and the Services and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations.

For avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding this Section 15(a), this Agreement does not modify, revise, or amend the terms of any other agreements you may have with Abodu.
  
  (b) Construction.
  If any portion of this Agreement is ruled invalid or otherwise unenforceable, it shall be deemed amended in order to achieve as closely as possible the same effect as originally drafted. Any invalid or unenforceable portion should be construed as narrowly as possible in order to give effect to as much of this Agreement as possible.
  
  (c) Headings.
  Descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of this Agreement.
  
  (d) No Waivers.
  Our failure to enforce or exercise any provision of this Agreement or related right will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
  
  (e) No Assignments and Transfers.
  No rights or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or transferred by you, either voluntarily or by operation of law, without our express written consent and in our sole discretion.
  
  (f) Language of this Agreement.
  Although this Agreement may be translated into other languages, the English language version of this Agreement shall control in any dispute between the parties.
  
  (g) No Third Party Beneficiaries.
  Nothing in this Agreement will confer upon any person, other than the parties, any rights, remedies, obligations, or liabilities whatsoever.
  
  (h) Notices.
  You can provide any notices to us under this Agreement by e-mail or mail using the contact information provided in Section 16. Unless you tell us otherwise, or the law requires otherwise, you agree to receive all communications from us by e-mail or through posting notices to your account. You are responsible for providing Abodu with up-to-date contact information, which you may do by updating your account information through the Site or by sending a message to us via the contact information provided in Section 16. You agree that all communications that we send to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that a communication be in writing. You may print the communications for your records.
