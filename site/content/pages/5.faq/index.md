    faq__list--item__question: 'Do ADUs affect my property value?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'Yes. Installing an Abodu in your backyard will certainly increase your property value. After all, it’s an additional 495 sq feet of permanent living space on your lot. The increased bedrooms, bathroom and kitchen are viewed as additions to the primary home.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'Will my property reassessed for tax purposes by adding an ADU?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'The answer is generally yes, but your property tax assessment will not increase based on the increased value of the entire lot, just the increased value from adding an Abodu. Customers tell us this is generally an increase of ~$1000 - $2000 per year.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'How does financing work for ADUs?'

    faq__list--item__question: 'How will you get the pre-fabricated ADU into my backyard?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'If you have plenty of access space for us to move it, via rollers, into the backyard, then we’ll do that. If you have a bit less access space, we will use a crane to lift the Abodu over your main home.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'Can I rent my ADU to anyone?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'Yes. If you live in the main house, you can rent your Abodu to anyone you please - aging parents, children back from school, the new teacher at your local elementary school, a local firefighter, etc. The possibilities are endless.'
  -

    faq__list--item__question: 'Are these ADUs considered mobile homes?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'No. Your Abodu unit is constructed in factory to the highest standards of modular home construction. Abodu units are built to be permanently installed on a foundation and permanently connected to utilities. They are considered “Real Property” once fully installed.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'Can I install an ADU on rental property and rent the main house and ADU to separate parties?'

    faq__list--item__question: 'How big can my ADU be?'

    faq__list--item__question: 'Can I customize my ADU to make it look how I want it to look?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'Yes. We offer multiple exterior siding options and colors, roofing colors and interior flooring and paint colors. You aren’t able to move any walls within your Abodu, but after the thousands of hours of design work we’ve put into Abodu, trust us - you won’t want to.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'Can I add solar to my ADU?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'Yes, we can add solar to your Abodu - no problem. How we install solar will look a little bit different whether or not your existing home currently has solar, but either way, it’s doable.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'How do I get electricity in my ADU?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'In most cases, we’ll “plug” your Abodu into the panel on your main home. We can run a dedicated electric service line to the unit, but frankly that’s a little bit more expensive. Also - depending on what type of panel you have, we might have to upgrade your panel before we do our install. We can help you manage that if you need, or you can do it on your own - just let us help you make sure you get the right size panel to fit your new Abodu.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'How do I get plumbing in my ADU?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'Generally, we’ll need to run the plumbing underground somewhere out into the front yard, and connect into a part of your yard that breaks off from the sewer main (that’s called the sewer lateral). In some cases, we’ll connect into the cleanout. There’s a few other things we need to take into account - how big the pipes are on your current system, how many bathrooms you have - but we’ll chat about that during a site visit.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'What type of foundation is this set on?'
    faq__list--item__answer: |
      Where possible, we use a concrete-less foundation, called helical piers. These are steel corkscrews that go deep into the ground at various points along the outside of the unit. They have a connection bracket on the top of each corkscrew that the unit sits on. It’s pretty heavy duty...helical piers are becoming increasingly popular because of their durability, strength, and ease of install. 
      
      Alternatively, we can also set an Abodu on a typical concrete perimeter foundation. This just requires a bit more time in your backyard - instead of 2 weeks, it could be as much as 4-6 weeks. We'd need to take a look at your site.

    faq__list--item__question: 'How do you run a gas line to the ADU?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'We don’t. Our units are all electric, because electric appliances are much more efficient and environmentally friendly. We use a top-of-the-line water heater, and our electric induction cooktop has rave reviews.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'How do ADU’s work with zoning?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'Bit of a loaded question… it depends. Zoning happens at a city-by-city level, and so we’ll have to know where you are. Since the state of California changed the laws around ADUs starting in 2017, ADU’s are now allowed in the backyards of all single family homes, with some restrictions in each local area (things like setbacks, size limits, etc.).'

    faq__list--item__question: 'What setbacks are required on my property?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'Depends on where you live. In some places, there are zero setbacks from the sides of your property. In others, there are setbacks of 10 feet or more. We can tell you pretty easily - just reach out to us.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'There’s an easement in my backyard. Can I still have an ADU?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'It depends. We’ll need to look at your title report, which we can help you pull if you don’t have one readily available. Some easements will still allow an ADU inside them, but will have restrictions such as height limits. Other easements don’t allow any structures inside them, so we’ll have to move your Abodu somewhere else on the property, if possible.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'Can you provide me with a fully furnished unit?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'No problem. If that’s what you want, we can help you furnish your Abodu with one of our pre-selected furniture packages.'

    faq__list--item__question: 'Does an Abodu have heating and air conditioning?'
    faq__list--item__answer: 'Yes. Your Abodu comes standard with heating and air conditioning. We want to ensure you don’t miss any of the comforts of home.'
